title: Welcome

This is my first post in *Poleiro*, a blog about the
[Coq proof assistant](http://coq.inria.fr). I plan to cover a broad
range of material about the use of Coq, from the most basic to the
very advanced.

All code for this blog is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/arthuraa/poleiro). My plan is to produce
posts directly from Coq code, so you can explore the repository to
try things for yourself.

Enjoy!
