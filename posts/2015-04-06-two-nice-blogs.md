title: Two nice Coq-related blogs
---

Here are two blogs with nice Coq-related content:

- Guillaume Claret, a Ph.D. student in Paris, has also a [blog][1]
  devoted to Coq. You can find some good articles in there, such as
  [this one][2], explaining how to use [OPAM][3] as a package manager
  for Coq.

- Ã–mer's [blog][4] has a lot of general programming-languages and
  functional-programming material. [This post][5], for instance,
  presents a simple exercise in dependently typed programming.
