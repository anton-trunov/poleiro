# About

My name is
[Arthur Azevedo de Amorim](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aarthur). I'm a
post-doctoral researcher at [CMU](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/).

This is a blog about the [Coq](http://coq.inria.fr) proof assistant
and programming language. With Coq, it is possible to develop
programs, write a specification capturing their intended behavior, and
prove that the specification is satisfied. That proof is then checked
by Coq to ensure that is logically valid. One can also use Coq to
formalize much of Mathematics. Great examples of its use in the real
world include [CompCert](http://compcert.inria.fr), a verified C
compiler, and the
[formalization](http://www.msr-inria.inria.fr/Projects/math-components)
of the
[Feit-Thompson theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feit%E2%80%93Thompson_theorem).

This blog is generated using [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/),
[Sass](http://sass-lang.org) and
[Compass](http://compass-style.org). All source files, including posts
and Coq developments, are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/arthuraa/poleiro).
